This program is of course heavily inspired by [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxAaO2rsdIs "3Blue1Brown's video to epidemics"). 
If you are looking for more information on epidemics check out the [SIR Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology "Wikipedia article on models used in epidemiology")
 and the [Basic Reproduction Number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_reproduction_number "Wikipedia Article on the Basic Reproduction Number").

### Disclaimer

I am by no means an epidemiologist and I made this just for fun.
